<!-- 🚀 New Project Alert: Tic-Tac-Toe Game! 🕹️

I'm excited to share my latest project—a fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This classic game allows players to take turns placing Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid with the aim of getting three in a row.

🔍 Key Features:
Interactive Game Board: Clickable cells to place your move.
Dynamic Status Updates: Game status updates to show whose turn it is or if there's a winner.
Winning Logic: Checks for winning combinations and declares the winner.
Draw Condition: Declares a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
Restart Functionality: Reset the game board to play again.
🛠 Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structured the game layout.
CSS3: Styled the game board and buttons for a vibrant and responsive interface.
JavaScript: Added game logic for handling player moves, checking for wins, and restarting the game.
📈 Project Details:
Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices.
User Experience: Intuitive and simple interface for all ages to enjoy.
Check out the project on GitHub and feel free to leave your feedback!
